# Are Models Art?

[[Chris Meddings]] recently published a [blog post titled "Is it Art though?"](https://modelphilosopher.com/is-it-art-though/), which really got me thinking about the questions

- are models art?
- wtaf is art?

The usual fallback here is the same as it was for Justice Potter Stewart and porn--"I know it when I see it". Which...
as much as I agree that any attempt to define art and provide cleanly delineated boundaries between it, and say, craft
(like a really well made chair) is impossible... still feels like a copout.

So let's be idiots and try and come up with a definition of art that may or may not encompass (some of)
[[modelling|scale modelling]].
