# Are Models Art?

[[Chris Meddings]] recently published a [blog post titled "Is it Art though?"](https://modelphilosopher.com/is-it-art-though/), which really got me thinking about the questions

- are models art?
- wtaf is art?

The usual fallback here is the same as it was for Justice Potter Stewart and porn--"I know it when I see it". Which...
as much as I agree that any attempt to define art and provide cleanly delineated boundaries between it, and say, craft
(like a really well made chair) is impossible... still feels like a copout.

So let's be idiots and try and come up with a definition of art that may or may not encompass (some of)
[[modelling|scale modelling]].

## Approach

I have some preconceived ideas of what constitutes art, so I'm going to start with some statements, that are kinda also
questions:

- art acts on its audience/does art have to act on its audience to be art?
- art doesn't have to be "good" to be art (though the quality does tend to limit the audience that will consider a given
  artifact "art")
- artists are their own first audience
- the creative act is an act of auto-exorcism on the part of the artist
- when that exorcism stops communicating something quotidien and unremarkable, and begins to communicate something new,
  that's when creativity becomes art
  - that "new" thing doesn't have to be original. Defamiliarizing something quotidien in a way that evokes a different
    understanding or appreciation of it would work here too
- is a beautifully made, but otherwise unremarkable, chair art? The Met appears to think things like this count. Do
  they?

## Acting on the audience

When people say things like "it's art if it makes you feel something", or "it leaves me cold", or "it's solipsistic",
this is sort of the space they're in.

Some art pushes you to feel something. Hollywood movies are *really* good at this (I mean, how weird is it to cry over
fictional characters we've known for maaaaybe an hour).

Some art, on the other hand, creates a void and kind of dares you to step into it, or fill it with your own thoughts. It
pisses people off because it's not clear. This is the same thing--provoking an emotional response. Just it's doing it by
creating a void that the audience feels compelled to fill, instead of filling the audience.

NGL, some highly conceptual art seems masturbatory to me when it's so obtuse, or requires so much insider knowledge to
appreciate that I can't help but wonder if anyone gets and the artist is just a charlatan or douchebag.

## Quality isn't a (primary) concern

Art doesn't have to be good to act on its audience. But quality does help you reach a greater audience.

There was a Cornish painter named [Alfred Wallis](https://cornwallartists.org/cornwall-artists/alfred-wallis) who was a
fisherman his whole life, and painted for himself in his free time and after he retired. He was entirely untrained. And
yet, ended up becoming a hero of the Cornish painting community (he'd tell them to fuck off) because his work was unique
in that it wasn't influenced by art schools and the preconceived notions of what painting should be. He'd paint with
house paint, on cardboard or scraps of wood.

His work didn't cohere with the modern expectations of "quality" in art, and yet he's one of the most famous painters to
come out of Cornwall.

Quality is both subjective, and not so important. But either it, or timeliness, does help you get a chance to get your
work in front of an audience.

## Artists are their own first audiences

Except for douche-nozzles like Damien Hirst who just intentionally makes soulless financial containers for
inflation-and-tax-proof investments, most artists are externalizing something that they have inside, that must be out.
[David Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRtZc_Nmo5w) said something along these lines. "There's something inside
yourself... that if you could manifest it in some way you would understand something more about yourself and how you
coexist with the rest of society".

This bridges the issue of quality, into the next idea about auto exorcism too.

Art has to satisfy its creator first, otherwise it's already failed and probably isn't art. Even in the cases where an
artist hates their work, it's usually a hatred borne of a perceived failing to achieve the goal, or a betrayal by the
piece, where it doesn't stick the landing the artist was aiming for.

And if you're not building to move yourself, you're unlikely to move any other audience.

## Auto-exorcism

As above, creation is an act of externalizing something inside. In the context of modelling, it might be trying to tell
a story you see about the despair of war, or the quiet bond of camraderie between soldiers. Or maybe it's just that you
truly love the shape of the P-38, and want to highlight it so that others see the same beauty you do.

But it's all an inside-out movement.

This isn't necessarily art yet, but it is pointing there.

## Transitioning from creation to making art

If something you have created can move or provoke someone other than yourself... then you're really getting somewhere.

I almost want to draw an arbitrary line in the sand here, that if you can expand the audience for a piece of art beyond
just yourself, then it really is art.

Even if you hate it.

This is the moment that a diorama moves from being the same old tank and a couple of smoking soldiers that everyone's
built, to being something that makes the audience appreciate it more, or in a more particular way.

Even if it is those same soldiers smoking around the tank... if you "make it sing", that's magic.

And if it's just a P-38, but the way you present it to us makes someone who never gave a shit about planes realize there
are some absolutely beautiful lines in the fighter, and that there's something special about WWII era fighters in
general... well. That's pretty cool. You just changed someone.

## Craft vs Art

I had a bullet point about nicely made chairs etc etc, but honestly after writing all that gobshite I think it's
redundant. If it moves you, then it's art. Doesn't have to be novel or anything.

## Wrapup

Look. There's nothing new here. But it's useful for me, at the very least, to articulate it all.

Now I have something to argue with myself over in 6 months when I've completely changed my mind.
