# Maschinen Krieger is a very sneaking modelling genre

In my last post I started waffling on about [[2023-09-25-are-models-art|whether models are art/what is art]], which was
prompted as a response to [[chris-meddings]] post about [the same
topic](https://modelphilosopher.com/is-it-art-though/). And then I sent a couple messages back and forth with him on
Instagram.

In those messages, I was trying to articulate something about sci-fi genres, and [[maschinen-krieger]] in particular,
that they feel "closer" to art, or that it's easier to get into the kind of creativity that's not just building
representation models.

I pointed out that [[max-watanabe]]'s work, even when it's "just" the model, carries a sense of play, like you know that
Max was just fucking around, having fun, and finding out. And that that's lovely.

And I still think that's true, but that's friggin' Max. He's a legend.

But I think there's something more about MaK, something really special, that slingshots a lot of the modellers who start
playing with it from doing "tanks like the tanks were" into exploring more, taking on more authorship, being more
playful.

And... the more I think about it, it's *exactly* that that it does. MaK looks like so many other historical modelling
genres. The shapes are straight out of WWII kits (...literally). The paint schemes and approaches to weathering could
fight right in on an armor builder's bench.

Which... I think is the *point*. It's a friggin' trojan horse. It lulls vanilla historical modellers into a false sense
of security with all the familiar trappings, then BAM, it pulls the rug out from underneath them and tricks them into
doing things that you *don't* do on historical subjects.

There *are* no reference images. You *can't* do research. (OK. This is straight up not true. There's the old Hobby Japan
articules from the 80s).

But even when you are doing that research, it's always clear that the reference you're using, the research you can find,
is all *fiction*. And recent. It's never far from sight that all of this crap is made up, it was written by someone, and
it's so easy to do that kind of writing yourself. Create an OC. Your own faction. A little story in your head to explain
how some Mercenary ended up in a Melusine.

Or, maybe even better, you don't speak Japanese, and you never found [Brian
Kreuger](http://www.maschinenkrueger.com/joomla4/)'s site, and you just have some boxes of cool kits that you got
because they seem kinda like WWII stuff, but are so clearly *fictional*. And that's freeing.

So yea. I think MaK tricks a lot of modellers into crossing from representational craft into authorship and art making.
Which is pretty friggin' cool.
