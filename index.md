# Flying Grizzly [dot] Net

Hey. I'm Sean. Welcome to my website. Isn't it cool.

## Reasons you might be here

Maybe you are interested in my [[software/projects]] or [[cv]]

### I wrote a thing about the design of the Zaku

[Check it out](https://www.flyinggrizzly.net/2019/04/zaku-design-origins/). [Mark
Simmons](http://ultimatemark.com/gundam/) said he thought it was pretty good. That made me very happy.

You probaby don't know me from this, but I write about lots of stuff. Like [how to make eggs benedict the lazy
way](https://www.flyinggrizzly.net/2017/01/06/eggs-half-a-dict/), or [cricket for people who like
baseball](https://www.flyinggrizzly.net/2017/07/28/cricket-casual-baseball-fan/), that Zaku research piece, art... you
